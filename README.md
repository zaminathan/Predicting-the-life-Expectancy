#Life Expectancy Prediction: Machine Learning Project
This project utilizes machine learning techniques to predict life expectancy based on a range of socio-economic and health-related factors. By analyzing historical data and applying various algorithms, the model aims to provide insights into life expectancy trends and factors influencing longevity. Key aspects include data preprocessing, feature selection, and the deployment of predictive models to enhance understanding and support public health initiatives.
